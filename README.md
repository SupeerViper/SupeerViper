**`Full Stack Web Developer`**

## Welcome to my github page! To give you a brief presentation i'm am a programmer. I started writing code a while when i was still in Highschool, it first began with HTML and CSS designing a project for class, and then continued with more sophisticated languages like Python(made a program that would rewrite the name of music filles after a patter) but then i wanted to step up my game with front-end developing Javascript(the front-end repository, with the help from a paid course, that i also got a diploma from), also learned a bunch of libraries and frameworks to go with it. And now i want to make a career out of it, because i loved even from when i was little the power of a computer and what you can do with it.
